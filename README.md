To add it to Firefox, Safari or Chrome, make sure you have a userscript extension such as Tampermonkey or Greasemonkey installed. Then open the link in that browser:

https://github.com/FVSSlovenia/Hybris-Cache-Companion/raw/master/Cache%20Companion_v0.1.user.js

And click install - now you need to edit the @match url to the page you are managing, so locate the following line:

// @match https://www.enterurlhere.com/*

You can of course add more pages by duplicating the line.
